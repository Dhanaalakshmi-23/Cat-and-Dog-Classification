# Cat-and-Dog-Classification

This project is a deep learning-based image classifier that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), it achieves accurate predictions by learning features from image datasets.

## 📌 Objective

To build and train a Convolutional Neural Network that can classify images into two categories:
- **Cat**
- **Dog**

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used contains images of cats and dogs, commonly sourced from the [Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/biaiscience/dogs-vs-cats). It is divided into training and validation sets for model development and performance evaluation.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consisting of:
- Convolution layers
- Max Pooling layers
- Dropout layers
- Dense (fully connected) layers
- Activation functions (ReLU, Softmax/Sigmoid)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV / PIL (for image processing)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-dog-classifier.git
   cd cat-dog-classifier
